## GitHub Copilot Integration

This repository is configured to work with GitHub Copilot to enhance the development experience. The `.github/copilot/` directory contains:

- **instructions.md**: Comprehensive guidelines for working with this repository
- **knowledge.md**: Technical knowledge about image hierarchy, build process, and testing
- **copilot-config.yml**: Reference configuration documenting code style, testing, and documentation preferences

These files serve as a knowledge base that contributors can reference when working with GitHub Copilot or other AI assistants to ensure suggestions align with our coding standards and practices.

## Our Copyright Policy

Jupyter uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright
over their contributions to Jupyter. But, it is important to note that these
contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the Jupyter
source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or
institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire Jupyter
Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what
changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate
their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the
change to one of the Jupyter repositories.

With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file
to indicate the copyright and license terms:

```text
# Copyright (c) Jupyter Development Team.
# Distributed under the terms of the Modified BSD License.
```
